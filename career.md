# Careers

*Illegal* career tasks can lead to confinement in the Brig if you fail
the task and are unlucky. In this case, your reputation with the station's
government also suffers. Higher Orwellian Levels make it more likely to be
confined in the case of task failures.

*Harmful* career tasks can send you to Sick Bay in case of failure.
